class Acceptor(multiprocessing.Process):
    """Work acceptor process.

    On start-up, `Acceptor` accepts a file descriptor which will be used to
    accept new work.  File descriptor is accepted over a `work_queue` which is
    closed immediately after receiving the descriptor.

    `Acceptor` goes on to listen for new work over the received server socket.
    By default, `Acceptor` will spawn a new thread to handle each work.

    However, when `--threadless` option is enabled, `Acceptor` process will also pre-spawns a
    `Threadless` process during start-up.  Accepted work is passed to these `Threadless` processes.
    `Acceptor` process shares accepted work with a `Threadless` process over it's dedicated pipe.

    TODO(abhinavsingh): Open questions:
    1) Instead of starting `Threadless` process, can we work with a `Threadless` thread?
    2) What are the performance implications of sharing fds between threads vs processes?
    3) How much performance degradation happens when acceptor and threadless processes are
       running on separate CPU cores?
    4) Can we ensure both acceptor and threadless process are pinned to the same CPU core?
