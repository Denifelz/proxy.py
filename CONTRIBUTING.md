# Contributing to proxy.py

This document describes how contributors can participate and iterate quickly while maintaining the `proxy.py` project standards and guidelines.

## Pre-requisite

1. Make sure you are using project recommended environment setup steps
2. Make sure you have setup necessary local git commit hooks.  This will save a lot of your time, as you will be able to identify lint errors like `missing trailing comma` quickly.  Make sure all tests and lint checks are passing before sending out a pull request

## Communication

During the process of PR review, sometimes, you might be asked to update certain project lint configs.  Example, you changed a piece of code, due to which we must enable/disable certain checks within `.pylintrc` and `.flake8`.

It's highly recommended that you must participate in maintaining a high code-quality standard.  For any reason, if you are unable to address the requested changes, please communicate the same to the reviewer.  Thank you!!!
